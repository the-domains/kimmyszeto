## Information Professional

I am currently assistant professor of the library at Baruch College, City University of New York. I manage the Digital Media Library, create metadata for e-books and online audiovisual materials, and guide the development of metadata standards for the system used to manage the digital photograph collections in campus offices such as marketing, communications, alumni relations, and athletics.

Previously, I was the cataloging and metadata librarian at SUNY Maritime College in the Bronx, NY. In addition to cataloging and creating metadata for archival materials, I provided reference services, teach information literacy, and served as the Federal Depository Libraries Program coordinator and the library's liaison to the Science Department.

I stepped into the library profession at Queens Library in Jamaica, NY. I began as a music cataloger, and later worked in the archives division as the metadata librarian. I was involved in developing metadata policy, cataloging and workflow design for the library's historical and institutional archives. At the reference desk, I provided services for historical and geneological research, visual and performing arts. For many years, I also specialized in cataloging areas of music, arts, sports, computers, science, comics, photographs, recordings, and maps.

In my research, I examine the confluence between the library catalog and the Semantic Web. I regularly share the latest in cataloging standards and metadata technologies to practicing and future librarians through articles, tutorials, presentations, and classroom teaching.

I also directed the library and design information services for the Argento New Music Project, a premiere chamber music ensemble based in New York City. I managed the ensemble library, experimented with workflows and logistics for digital music scores delivery, and ensured compliance with intellectual property laws.
